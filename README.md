# MyToken - Solidity Contract

This Solidity program is a simple token contract that demonstrates the basic functionality of creating, minting, and burning tokens. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for those who are new to Solidity and want to understand how token contracts work.

## Description

This program is a contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has public variables to store details about the token (Token Name, Token Abbreviation, Total Supply), a mapping to store balances of addresses, and functions to mint and burn tokens. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

## Getting Started

### Executing Program

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.18" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.

Once the contract is deployed, you can interact with it by calling the `mintToken` and `burnToken` functions. Click on the "MyToken" contract in the left-hand sidebar, and then use the respective functions to mint and burn tokens.
